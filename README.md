# My First Repository 
## My First Github Trial Repository
I need to *learn to use* **Github** for class. 

I hope I can *learn it fast*.

I am __very excited that I am starting to use it__!

I will certainly try to:
* Work **as hard as** I can
* If possible I will try to *practice everyday*
* I will keep in mind that *everything new is hard*
* I will remind myself that all *the hard work*, will certainly __Open Up New Doors For Me!__
